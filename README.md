# Flutter E-comerse — Open Quick Commerce Platform

This repository is a starter scaffold for an open-source quick-commerce mobile app (food & grocery delivery) similar in concept to Zomato and Blinkit.

Project vision
- Open-source platform for quick commerce where revenue/profits are shared with delivery workers.
- Decentralized operation: no single owner or central controller — community-driven development and governance.

Planned core features
- Browsing restaurants & grocery stores
- Product listings, search and filters
- Cart, checkout and order tracking
- Rider/delivery partner onboarding and payouts
- Real-time order status and notifications
- Ratings, reviews, and basic analytics

What is in this repo now
- `lib/main.dart` — minimal Flutter UI starter
- `pubspec.yaml` — dependencies and assets
- `analysis_options.yaml` — lint rules
- `.github/workflows/android.yml` — CI workflow to build Android APK
- `scripts/create_platforms.sh` — helper to generate native platform folders

Local setup
```bash
# generate native platform folders (android/ios/web/windows)
./scripts/create_platforms.sh

# fetch packages
flutter pub get

# run on Android device/emulator
flutter run

# run on web (Chrome)
flutter run -d chrome

# build release APK
flutter build apk --release
```

CI / GitHub Actions
- A workflow is included at `.github/workflows/android.yml`. On push to `main` (or via manual dispatch) the workflow:
	- installs Flutter
	- runs `flutter create .` to ensure native folders exist

	An open-source quick-commerce mobile app (food & grocery delivery) focused on fair revenue sharing and community governance.

	**Project idea**
	- Build a lightweight, extensible quick-commerce platform for neighbourhood delivery.
	- Prioritize fair pay: all revenue (after operational costs) is shared with delivery partners.
	- Platform/server hosting is funded by voluntary donations from users, community members, and delivery partners.
	- Open-source contributors are encouraged to extend and improve features; the project is community-driven.

	**Key Features (planned / in-progress)**
	- Store & Restaurant discovery (categories, search, filters)
	- Product listings, configurable menus, and stock management
	- Cart, checkout, multiple payment gateway hooks (pluggable)
	- Real-time order lifecycle: placed → preparing → picked up → delivered
	- Delivery partner onboarding, availability, and payout tracking
	- Delivery tracking (rider location) and ETA estimation
	- Ratings, reviews, and disputes resolution tools
	- Basic analytics and reporting dashboards for stores and partners
	- Localization-ready (i18n) and theming for quick customization
	- Modular architecture so contributors can add features/plugins

	**Revenue & Funding Model**
	- Revenue sharing: Net revenue generated by the platform will be shared with delivery partners. Specific split percentages should be documented in a governance/treasury policy and agreed by the community.
	- Funding platform/server costs: Hosting and server expenses will be covered by donations from users, community members, and delivery partners. The project is intended to minimize central profit-taking and maximize fair distribution.
	- Transparency: All funds and payouts should be recorded and published by the governance process (suggested: simple ledger + periodic reports).

	**Why this approach?**
	- Aligns incentives: delivery partners are core stakeholders and should benefit directly from platform success.
	- Low barrier to participation: community contributors can improve the platform without proprietary lock-in.

	**Repository Contents**
	- `lib/main.dart` — Flutter app entrypoint (starter UI)
	- `pubspec.yaml` — dependencies and asset configuration
	- `analysis_options.yaml` — linting rules
	- `assets/images/` — app images and illustrations (logo, hero)
	- `scripts/create_platforms.sh` — helper to generate native platform folders
	- `.github/workflows/` — CI workflows (Android build, etc.)

	**Local setup & development**
	1. Ensure Flutter is installed and on your `PATH`.
	2. Create platform folders (if needed):

	```bash
	./scripts/create_platforms.sh
	```

	3. Fetch dependencies and run the app:

	```bash
	flutter pub get
	flutter run
	```

	4. To run on web (Chrome):

	```bash
	flutter run -d chrome
	```

	5. Build a release APK:

	```bash
	flutter build apk --release
	```

	**CI / GitHub Actions**
	- A workflow is included that installs Flutter, ensures native folders exist, runs `flutter pub get`, builds an Android release APK, and uploads the artifact. Review `.github/workflows/android.yml` for details and to add signing steps.

	**Contributing**
	- Contributions are warmly welcomed. Suggested workflow:
		1. Fork the repo.
		2. Create a feature branch.
		3. Open a PR with a clear description and tests/screenshots where applicable.
	- Open issues for feature requests, bugs, and proposals for the revenue/governance model.
	- If you want to contribute code for payout accounting, payment integrations, or governance tooling, please open an issue first to coordinate design.

	**Donations & sponsorship**
	- This project accepts donations to cover hosting, CI, and shared services. Consider adding a `DONATE.md` and linking a transparent donation address or a community treasury.

	**Governance & payouts**
	- Add a simple governance document describing how revenue is calculated, how and when payouts to delivery partners are distributed, and who can review treasury transactions. A basic model to start:
		- Collect gross revenue per-period.
		- Deduct documented operational costs (hosting, third-party fees).
		- Remaining net revenue is distributed to delivery partners per agreed formula.

	**Security & privacy**
	- Do not store sensitive payment secrets in the repository. Use environment variables or secret management in CI.
	- Follow best practices for user data privacy and obtain necessary permissions for location tracking.

	**License**
	- Add a license (e.g., `LICENSE` with MIT or Apache-2.0) to make the project clearly open-source.

	**Next steps I can help with**
	- Add/update a `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`, and `DONATE.md`.
	- Add initial governance / treasury policy draft.
	- Implement basic payout-accounting module or simple demo.

	Thank you for building something community-first — contributors and delivery partners make this possible.
